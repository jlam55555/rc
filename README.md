# rc
My configuration files (a.k.a. dotfiles/rcfiles).

### About
These are not meant to be an one-size-fits-all or works out-of-the-box solution, but
rather useful mixins that I use across setups. I use this to quickly get started
on a new computer with a consistent setup.

### Files
These are all intended to be relative to the users's home directory.
- [`.Xdefaults`](.Xdefaults): Xterm configuration
- [`.emacs.d/init.el`](.emacs.d/init.el): Emacs configuration
- [`.screenrc`](.screenrc): GNU screen configuration
- [`.bashrc`](.bashrc): Useful mixins for Bash
